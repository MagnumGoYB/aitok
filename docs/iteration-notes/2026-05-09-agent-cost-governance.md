# 2026-05-09 Agent Cost Governance Iteration

This note is a versioned handoff for future AI coding agents. Read it before continuing cost governance, pricing coverage, budget enforcement, `doctor`, GitHub automation, or release work.

## Fast Resume

- Repo: `/Users/sosbs/coding/aitok`
- PR: `https://github.com/MagnumGoYB/aitok/pull/11`
- Release: `https://github.com/MagnumGoYB/aitok/releases/tag/v0.1.15`
- Feature branch used: `codex/aitok-local-cost-governance`
- Release commit: `918137e75c9412fe831eeef60de82a23427b870e`
- Release tag: `v0.1.15`
- Primary agent contract: `--format json --no-version-check`

## Why This Iteration Happened

The product review identified the highest-value next step as local cost governance rather than another token table. Users and AI agents need to answer:

- Am I over budget?
- Which tool, model, or working directory is unusual?
- Can automation call this safely without parsing human text?
- Can all of this work offline from local logs?

The implementation therefore prioritized performance, offline behavior, and stable machine-readable CLI output.

## Timeline

1. Brainstormed the core value areas: budget/threshold checks, trend/compare reports, project-level insights, a stronger `doctor`, and pricing coverage audit.
2. Implemented the first governance slice in PR #11: streaming scan, accumulator aggregation, pricing audit, budget check, and `doctor` improvements.
3. Investigated a pricing coverage report showing `known 20231`, `unknown 30`, and `unknown_models 1`.
4. Fixed the missing bundled price coverage for `codex-auto-review / bcb`.
5. Renamed misleading pricing report fields from `unknown_*` to `unpriced_*` / `priced_events`.
6. Merged PR #11.
7. Released `v0.1.15` with GoReleaser artifacts for darwin, linux, and windows.
8. Added this repository-level handoff note so future sessions do not depend on Codex global memory indexing.
9. Removed always-on CodeRabbit review because the recurring paid PR review gate was not worth the cost for this repository.
10. Added `make setup` and PR-side latest-commit commitlint so human commits and agent commits share the same commit-message contract.
11. Added an explicit PR release-decision gate so engineering/process-only changes do not trigger software releases, while feature and bugfix work must mark a follow-up release or an explicit deferral.

## Product Decisions

- `aitok` remains a human CLI, but AI Agent and automation reliability are a first-class product priority.
- The stable automation path is `--format json --no-version-check`.
- JSON stdout must remain a complete machine-readable payload.
- Human-readable warnings, version prompts, and budget failure explanations belong on stderr or in the returned error path.
- `budget check` can return non-zero when a budget is exceeded, but it must still emit structured JSON on stdout.
- Offline-first remains mandatory: no usage-data upload, no remote sync, and no automatic pricing network sync.
- Cost estimates are offline estimates, not billing reconciliation.

## Shipped Scope

- Added streaming source scanning with `internal/sources.Scan` and `sources.ForEach`.
- Added `internal/query.Accumulator` for lower-memory aggregation.
- Added `aitok pricing audit`.
- Added `aitok budget check --limit-usd`.
- Enhanced `aitok doctor --format table|json|markdown` as an onboarding/audit surface.
- Added governance report code in `internal/report/governance.go`.
- Added query benchmark coverage in `internal/query/query_bench_test.go`.
- Updated README, AGENTS, and planning documentation.

## Pricing Coverage Details

The confusing report was not saying all events were unknown. It showed many priced events plus 30 unpriced events from one missing model/provider pair.

Root cause:

- Missing bundled pricing coverage for `codex-auto-review / bcb`.

Fix:

- Added default pricing coverage for that model/provider pair.
- Changed report language from `unknown_*` to `unpriced_*` / `priced_events`.

Future pricing work should preserve the distinction between:

- parseable events
- priced events
- unpriced events
- unrecognized model/provider combinations

## 2026-05-13 Usage Accuracy Bugfix

Release target: `v0.1.28`.

The user reported that `summary --period yesterday` did not match the locally verified CC-Switch result for `2026-05-12 00:00 ~ 2026-05-13 00:00`. CC-Switch was treated as the reference product contract for this bugfix.

Root causes:

- Codex session logs expose `total_token_usage` as a cumulative counter. `aitok` was treating each `last_token_usage` row as an independent request and only deduplicating exact repeats, so period totals, request counts, cache totals, and costs drifted across all periods.
- Claude session logs can contain multiple rows for the same `message.id`; intermediate rows without `stop_reason` are not final API calls. `aitok` was counting those rows.
- Model names were not normalized consistently for provider prefixes or date suffixes.
- The cost formula still charged cached input at full input price for non-Codex tools and counted Codex `reasoning_output_tokens` as billable output. CC-Switch calculates cost from `(input_tokens - cache_read_tokens)`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, and `cache_creation_tokens`.

Fix:

- Codex now prefers `total_token_usage`, computes a per-file delta, skips zero-delta boundary rows, falls back to `last_token_usage` only when cumulative totals are absent, and scans `~/.codex/archived_sessions`.
- Claude now groups rows by `message.id`, keeps the final row with `stop_reason`, chooses the larger output row when finality is tied, and skips incomplete or zero-output rows.
- Codex and Claude model names are normalized by lowercasing, stripping provider prefixes, and stripping date suffixes.
- Offline cost estimation now follows the CC-Switch formula and does not add reasoning tokens into output cost.

Reference smoke after the fix:

- Period: `yesterday`, window `2026-05-12T00:00:00+08:00` to `2026-05-13T00:00:00+08:00`.
- Requests: `875`.
- Total tokens: `60,718,109`; input `60,398,385`; output `319,724`.
- Cached tokens: `103,962,752`.
- Cost: `$75.8474705`, displayed as `$75.8475`.
- Model totals: `claude-opus-4-7=852,249`, `gpt-5.5=43,968,237`, `gpt-5.4=15,897,623`.

Validation:

- `go test ./internal/pricing ./internal/sources`.
- `make test`.
- `make build`.
- `git diff --check`.
- `go run ./cmd/aitok summary --period yesterday --format json --no-version-check`.
- `go run ./cmd/aitok summary --period this-week --format json --no-version-check`.

## Tooling And Cache Decision

## 2026-05-14 Interactive Pricing Configuration

Release target: `v0.1.29`.

Follow-up feature: local pricing overrides can now be created from the terminal with `aitok pricing configure`.

Key contract:

- The command writes `~/.aitok/pricing.json` using `0600` permissions and supports both numbered terminal Q/A prompts and scripted flag-only setup.
- Matching remains `model match + provider/auth label`; raw API keys must not be entered, stored, displayed, hashed, or fingerprinted.
- Use provider/auth labels already present in local tool logs, for example Codex `model_provider` or Gemini `auth_type`, when a user wants different prices for different account or API-key-backed routes.
- JSON mode keeps prompts on stderr and returns the final machine-readable payload on stdout.

Validation for this slice:

- `make check`
- `make test`
- `make test-harness`
- `make build`
- CLI smoke with `make run ARGS="--home /private/tmp/aitok-pricing-smoke --no-version-check pricing configure --format json"`
- Local `toska` provider pricing verification: summary cost matched the configured input/output/cache-hit rates and `pricing audit --provider toska` returned no unpriced rows for the period.

Earlier validation used `/tmp` or `/private/tmp` for Go caches only because the sandbox denied Go default cache writes under `~/Library/Caches`.

The durable project-local direction is:

- keep validation caches under `.cache/aitok`
- use Makefile targets instead of ad-hoc temp commands
- use `make run ARGS="..."` for CLI smoke from a checkout instead of raw `go run`
- run `make setup` once per checkout to enable `.githooks/commit-msg`
- run commit message validation through `make commitlint COMMIT_MSG_FILE=<commit-msg-file>`
- let PR CI validate the latest PR commit message so contributors who did not run local setup are still covered

Temporary files like `/tmp/aitok-commit-msg` are not project tooling. They were only ephemeral command inputs.

## 2026-05-14 Codex Provider Switch Cost Attribution

Bugfix target: next patch release after `v0.1.29`.

The user reported that when a single Codex conversation switches provider, final estimated costs can stay under the provider that created the session instead of the provider active for each request.

Root cause:

- Codex parsing kept `state.provider` from `session_meta.model_provider`.
- Later turns already carried provider-qualified model strings such as `team-b/gpt-5.4`, but `aitok` only stripped that prefix while normalizing the model name. It did not reuse the prefix as the event provider.
- Some Codex turns only carried a bare model name such as `gpt-5.5`; for those rows, the per-request provider can only be recovered when local Codex logs contain a request URL that maps to exactly one configured provider host.
- Provider-specific pricing therefore could merge a later request into the session's original provider bucket.

Fix:

- Codex model parsing now returns both normalized model and optional provider prefix.
- `turn_context.payload.model`, token-count `info.model`, token-count `info.model_name`, and token-count `payload.model` update the active event provider when the model string is provider-qualified.
- For bare Codex model names, aitok also reads local Codex request-log evidence and maps request hosts back to `[model_providers.*].base_url` in `~/.codex/config.toml` when the host is unique. Same-turn request evidence applies to all token-count rows in that turn, including token counts emitted before the request-completed log line. Sparse bare turns between provider anchors stay on the earlier provider segment until later switch evidence appears.
- Logs without a provider-qualified model still fall back to `session_meta.model_provider`, preserving old-session compatibility.
- Unknown hosts, ambiguous shared hosts, missing request URL evidence, and provider URL rotations that are no longer represented in the current local config are intentionally not inferred.
- Query grouping only reassigns short inferred bridge segments bracketed by exact request evidence for Model Usage display; longer inferred provider segments stay on the provider already attached to each event.

Acceptance:

- A single Codex session with `team-a/gpt-5.4` followed by `team-b/gpt-5.4` emits separate provider buckets.
- A single Codex session with bare model names can split providers when the matching turn has unique request-host evidence.
- Same-provider URL changes do not bleed the previous host attribution into later turns; unknown rotated URLs fall back to session/model metadata.
- Provider-specific pricing applies `team-a` and `team-b` rates independently instead of charging both requests under the original provider.
- The behavior remains offline-only and does not inspect API keys.

Validation for this slice:

- `make test-packages PKGS="./internal/sources ./internal/cli"`

## 2026-05-15 To 2026-05-17 Provider Attribution Follow-Ups

Release span: `v0.1.31` through `v0.1.37`.

After the first provider-switch fix, the user continued validating real local totals and mixed provider pricing. Treat this period as a product-contract hardening phase, not cosmetic report work.

Important follow-up changes:

- `v0.1.31`: rebalanced Codex mixed-provider usage so a single conversation can produce separate provider cost buckets when the evidence supports a split.
- `v0.1.32`: preserved mixed price components in query/report output so `mixed` pricing remains explainable instead of collapsing into one opaque row.
- `v0.1.33`: reduced multi-tool summary overhead after week/month summaries became slow on larger local logs.
- `v0.1.34`: respected Codex `ChatGPT` auth mode in provider split logic.
- `v0.1.35`: sped up week and month summaries, keeping the performance work streaming-first.
- `v0.1.36`: restored Codex same-turn provider attribution after later evidence showed some token rows and request evidence can arrive in the same logical turn but different log order.
- `v0.1.37`: released the same-turn attribution fix and the preceding performance/provider corrections.

Durable rules from this period:

- A visible `mixed` price is not automatically a display-only issue. It may indicate a deeper aggregation or rebalancing problem. Validate with live `summary` output when the user reports real totals.
- Provider split logic should prefer exact evidence from provider-qualified model strings and request-host mappings, then apply conservative same-turn or short-bridge inference only when the evidence is bounded.
- Do not infer provider from API keys. Provider grouping may only use local provider/auth metadata and request-host evidence already present in local tool logs and config.
- Performance fixes must keep source scanning streaming. Do not solve week/month latency by loading large JSONL logs fully into memory.
- Mixed provider costs should stay explainable in both TUI and non-TUI reports. When showing a total cost, preserve the component breakdown if the data contains multiple provider-specific prices.

Validation expectation for future work in this area:

- Use targeted package checks while iterating, then `make validate` before release.
- Include at least one fixture or smoke path for provider-qualified model strings, bare model names with unique request-host evidence, same-turn evidence, unknown host fallback, and mixed price component reporting.
- For user-reported total mismatches, run a live `make run ARGS="--no-version-check summary ..."` smoke on the reported period instead of relying only on unit tests.

## Process Automation Updates

CodeRabbit:

- CodeRabbit was uninstalled/disabled externally and `.coderabbit.yaml` was removed from the repository.
- Keep required review gates on GitHub-native checklist comments, CODEOWNERS, branch protection, required checks, and scoped Dependabot auto-merge.
- Do not re-add always-on paid AI review automation by default. Use paid or external AI review only as a deliberate one-off decision for high-risk changes.

Commitlint:

- `make setup` now runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- `.githooks/commit-msg` runs `make commitlint COMMIT_MSG_FILE="$1"`.
- `.github/workflows/pr.yml` validates every commit in the PR range with `make commitlint-range COMMIT_RANGE="<base>..<head>"`, so local setup is helpful but not the only gate.
- Commit emoji is type-specific and has exactly one allowed value per type: `✨ feat`, `🐛 fix`, `📝 docs`, `👷 ci`, `💄 style`, `♻️ refactor`, `🔖 release`, `⚡️ perf`, `✅ test`, `🔧 chore`, and `🏗️ build`.

Release decision:

- `.github/pull_request_template*.md` now contains a required `Release Decision` section.
- `tools/validate-pr-body` requires that section and rejects feature/bugfix PRs that mark release as not required without an explicit deferral.
- Engineering/process-only changes such as harness, docs, CI, workflow guardrails, or repository automation should mark `Release not required`.
- Feature and bugfix changes should mark `Release required after merge` and continue into the existing release flow after merge unless the user explicitly defers release work.

## Validation Evidence

Feature PR checks run locally:

- `go test ./internal/cli`
- `go test ./internal/pricing ./internal/report ./internal/cli`
- `go test ./internal/query -bench . -benchmem`
- `make check`
- `make test`
- `make build`

Release validation:

- `make validate` passed locally before tagging.
- GitHub Actions release run succeeded: `https://github.com/MagnumGoYB/aitok/actions/runs/25598864490`
- GoReleaser uploaded darwin, linux, windows artifacts and `checksums.txt`.

## GitHub Automation Notes

`gh pr edit` may fail in this repository because GitHub Projects classic GraphQL fields are deprecated. If PR body edits hit that issue, use the REST API:

```sh
jq -Rs '{body:.}' <body.md> > <body.json>
gh api repos/MagnumGoYB/aitok/pulls/<number> -X PATCH --input <body.json>
```

PR metadata validation expects explicit coverage for requirement classification, acceptance criteria evidence, unit tests, failure/edge coverage, skipped validation, and residual risk.

PR metadata now also expects an explicit release decision. For feature and bugfix PRs, `Release not required` is invalid unless the body states an explicit user-approved deferral.

`make validate-pr-body` can be tested locally by setting `PR_BODY` to a realistic PR body. Running it without `PR_BODY` or `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` intentionally fails with empty-body errors.

## Next Work

Highest value:

- Add trend/compare reports: today vs yesterday, this week vs last week, and month daily breakdown.
- Improve project/repo normalization by folding deep `cwd` paths to git roots.
- Continue deepening `doctor` with data source paths, latest event time, Gemini telemetry safety, pricing coverage, and unpriced models.

Engineering constraints:

- Keep future performance work streaming-first and benchmarked.
- Keep JSON output stable and tested when fields change.
- Do not add network upload or automatic pricing sync.
